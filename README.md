# Autonmous-Vehicle-React-Native-Application
Our goal was to develop a self-driving autonomous car in Pakistan by integrating hardware and software technologies. The car used coordinates from a mobile app to navigate, traveling autonomously without human intervention. It had obstacle detection, avoidance, and lane following capabilities, with real-time communication through the internet.
